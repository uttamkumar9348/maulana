                        <p class="text-justify">The concept behind the Logo of Mahatma Gandhi Central University, Bihar (MGCUB) is derived from the Charkha, an iconic symbol representing Mahatma Gandhi. The Charkha is wrapping tricolor yarn spun by its dynamic activities symbolizing our national flag making it a University of national importance. Charka (form of wheel) is a symbolic representation for the progress and growth. The spinning wheel has been used metaphorically to signify transformation of raw material into a productive material that fabricates our society. This represents the national unity, dynamism and overall progress. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The color of Charkha is depicted in indigo blue connoting the first public movement against colonial rule by Mahatma Gandhi, the Champaran movement (Indigo Movement) one of the significant event of the region.

It is believed that there is a group of eight deities, Asta Dikpala <img src="{{asset('web/images/hindi-txt.jpg')}}" alt="hindi text" width="78" height="16" /> called literally meaning guardians of eight directions.  Asthang Yog (Eightfold yoga) of Patanjali, Sashtang Namaskar (best salutation with whole body), Asht dhatu (considered sacred alloy), Asth prahar (eight divisions of day), ashtkoniya sthapatya (octagonal architecture) are other examples.

                        <p class="text-justify">The Dharmacakra, a Buddhist symbol, has eight spokes. Buddha's principal teaching - the Four Noble Truths - ramifies as the Noble Eightfold Path and Buddha has emphasized upon the importance of the eight attainments. </p>

                        <p class="text-justify"><b>In Islam</b>, eight is the number of angels carrying the throne of Allah in heaven, and the number of gates of bahisht (heaven).</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">"Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water." (Bible, King James Version, 1. Peter: 20)</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Beatitudes are 8 blessings recounted in the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew. (Matthew 5:1-12)</p>

                            Shri Sukta of the Rig-Veda and it means- ‘I be blessed with prosperity, name and
                            fame’. Prosperity is not limited only to the acquisition of wealth and property but
                            it encompasses the overall human development, which is indeed the primary
                            responsibility of any University. In a knowledge society, prosperity cannot be
                            had without knowledge and without prosperity it is futile to yearn for name and
